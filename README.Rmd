# runningEmu

```{r}
library(runningEmu)
```

The goal of runningEmu is to create an environment for a Hacky Hour competition

## Example

There are 3 functions to be optimized in this package.

Below are the runtimes for one evaluation of these functions

```{r}
m <- matrix(rnorm(1e8), nrow=1e4)
bench::system_time(un(m))
bench::system_time(deux())
bench::system_time(trois())
```

And here are the runtimes for 50 evaluations of these functions.

```{r}
bench::mark(un(m), iterations = 50)
bench::mark(deux(), iterations = 50)
bench::mark(trois(), iterations = 50)
```
